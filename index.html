          My name is Braeden Weaver, I'm a junior at Illinois Institute of
          Technology in Chicago, IL. I really enjoy low level systems
          programming, making cheats for games, and compiler/decompiler
          theory. My campus looks like this when it's nice out:

          I like playing lacrosse, and I played for IIT up until sophomore
          year. I played it all through high school, and most of middle school
          as well. It's a really fun sport and it's growing a lot, I recommend
          everyone to check it out some time. If you've never seen it, it
          looks like this:
