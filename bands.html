        <h2>Bands I like</h2>
        <p>
          These are all bands that I enjoy listening to, they have a pretty
          unique style and that's something I appreciate. Modern Baseball is the
          only band in this list with a real "logo" for their band, Old Gray's
          picture that I chose is just the cover art of one of their albums. Hot
          Mulligan uses their pink text "logo" sometimes on merch and posters
          for their concerts.

            I really like Modern Baseball and I learned about them in my
            sophomore year of high school. A good friend named Bo let me know
            about them and I've never stopped listening.

            Bo also told me about this band, I've been to three of their
            concerts and I really like them. Their sound has definetely evolved
            and I don't like their newer albums as much, but still an amazing
            band.

          <h3>Old Gray</h3>
          <img

            Bo did not show me this band, and surprisingly he doesn't really
            like them. I think they make good music, not for everyone though.

          My favorite song by all of these bands is The Thrash Particle by
          Modern Baseball.
